## Radcacl: Android Privacy policy

This is an open source Android app developed by Aldoniel. The source code is available on GitHub under the CeCILL 2.1 licence ; the app is also available on Google Play.


I have programmed this app to respect by design you privacy and data :
- My code does not send any information over internet and fully works offline. There is no audience nor ad tracker.
- The android app only remembers that you accepted the licence and the last calculator you used (to restore it at launch). Everything else only lives in memory and is cleared by the system when you close the app. You can clear everything by deleting the cache or uninstalling.
